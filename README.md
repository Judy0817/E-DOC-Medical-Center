The E_DOC University Medical Center Management Web Application revolutionizes patient information management by seamlessly transitioning from a paper-based system to an intuitive web platform. Aimed at addressing the time constraints faced by students and medical staff in accessing patient histories, this application provides a secure and user-friendly environment. By requiring only email addresses and passwords for login, users can efficiently view and manage their medical history. The ability to upload scanned medicals enhances record accuracy, and students can easily retrieve past prescriptions. Furthermore, the application facilitates real-time updates on medicine stocks, ensuring medical staff stay informed about the center's current situation. With its commitment to user convenience, security, and comprehensive patient care, this project serves as a pivotal advancement in medical record management at E_DOC University Medical Center
